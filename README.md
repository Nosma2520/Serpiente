# Serpiente

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game in Java, using the `java.io`, `java.swing`, and `java.awt` packages to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game. The objective of the game is to control the snake's movement and eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or its own body.

## Features
* Classic snake gameplay with intuitive controls.
* Randomly generated apples for the snake to eat.
* Keeps track of the player's score.
* Game over when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
* Simple and clean user interface.
